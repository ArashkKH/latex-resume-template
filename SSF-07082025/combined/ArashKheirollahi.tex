\textbf{Re: Application for Member Services Staff – Fall 2025 (Part-Time)}

Dear Hiring Committee,

I'm writing to express my interest in the \textbf{Member Services Staff} position at Seneca Student Federation. As a current full-time student in the Computer Programming program at Seneca, and someone who values student engagement and support, I see this role as a meaningful opportunity to contribute to our community while strengthening my own skills in communication and service.

Through my past work experiences — including a front-desk role at a physiotherapy clinic and freelance web development — I’ve developed strong interpersonal, administrative, and problem-solving abilities. Whether supporting patients with scheduling and insurance paperwork, or walking clients through technical details in a project, I’ve learned the importance of clear communication, patience, and adaptability.

I’m particularly excited by the opportunity to help other students navigate services like the Health and Dental Plan and the Shuttle Bus Service. I’m comfortable using platforms like Zoom, Teams, and live chat tools, and I’m confident in my ability to provide helpful, respectful, and accurate support to diverse individuals.

I'm enthusiastic about working with the SSF team and contributing to a welcoming, inclusive atmosphere on campus. Thank you for considering my application. I’d love the chance to further discuss how I can support students and the goals of the Member Services department.

Sincerely,\\
Arash Kheirollahi
