\textbf{Re: Job ID 234492 – Court Services Officer}

\vspace{1em}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Court Services Officer position (Job ID 234492) with the Ministry of the Attorney General. With proven experience in customer service, administrative support, and handling confidential records, I bring the professionalism, tact, and organizational skills required to contribute effectively in a courtroom environment.

In my role as a Management Assistant at Physio Health Care Clinic, I managed patient intake, scheduling, and billing for a high-volume office while safeguarding sensitive records in compliance with privacy standards. This experience taught me to balance accuracy, discretion, and respectful service in a fast-paced setting. Previously, in client-facing roles with EzWeb and Beman Branding Agency, I worked with diverse groups—including government representatives—to resolve issues, maintain detailed records, and support team operations. These positions strengthened my ability to communicate clearly, adapt under pressure, and maintain decorum in sensitive situations.

I am particularly drawn to this role because it aligns with my strengths in organization, problem-solving, and collaboration. I am confident that my ability to manage competing priorities, uphold confidentiality, and support judicial officials with professionalism would allow me to contribute positively to the Ministry’s commitment to service excellence.

I welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background and skills match the requirements of this role. I can be reached at 416-627-9876 or \href{mailto:arashkhe@gmail.com}{arashkhe@gmail.com}. Thank you for your time and consideration.
