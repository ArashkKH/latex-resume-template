# LaTeX Resume Template

This is a clean and modern LaTeX resume template I created during my own job search in the tech industry. It’s best suited for roles in:

* Software Development
* Software Engineering
* DevOps
* Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
* And other developer-related positions

That said, it can easily be adapted to other fields as well.

## Who is this for?

This template is especially ideal for:

* New grads
* Students applying for co-ops or internships
* Anyone early in their tech career

## How to Use

You can compile the resume however you like, but I personally used [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), a fantastic online LaTeX editor that makes managing multiple versions of your resume super convenient.

The template is filled with placeholder data so you can easily customize it to your own experience and style.
