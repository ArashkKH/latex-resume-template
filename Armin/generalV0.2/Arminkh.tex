\textbf{Re: Job ID 234310 – Security/Patrol Officer}

\vspace{1em}

I am writing to express my interest in the Security/Patrol Officer position (Job ID 234310) with the Ontario Provincial Police, Security Bureau. With experience in client-facing roles, administrative support, and handling sensitive information, I bring strong communication skills, sound judgement, and a proven ability to maintain safety, security, and professionalism in demanding environments.

In my role as a Management Assistant at Physio Health Care Clinic, I managed front-desk operations, including patient intake, scheduling, and records management, while ensuring privacy and respectful service. This required vigilance, discretion, and the ability to calmly resolve issues in a fast-paced setting. At EzWeb, I worked with government and corporate clients to troubleshoot urgent matters, train users, and document incidents. These experiences strengthened my problem-solving, conflict resolution, and technical reporting skills—key requirements for responding to incidents, completing security reports, and applying procedures consistently. Earlier roles further developed my interpersonal abilities, allowing me to interact effectively with diverse groups and de-escalate challenging situations.

I am confident that my background in customer service, confidentiality, and operational support aligns well with the qualifications for this position. I am committed to contributing to the OPP’s mandate of ensuring safety and security, and I am prepared to meet all requirements for Special Constable status, including First Aid/CPR, Use of Force training, and enhanced security clearance.

I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications. I can be reached at 416-627-9876 or \href{mailto:arashkhe@gmail.com}{arashkhe@gmail.com}. Thank you for your time and consideration.
